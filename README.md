USE CASE:

Run the main file Encryption.java. Console will prompt user for a single
line string input s. String must satisfy the following constraint where
1 <= s <= 81 characters and consists of char in ascii[a-z]. The program
will then encrypt the string based on its length and print the encrypted
string.
